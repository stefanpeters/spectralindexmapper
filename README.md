Spectral Index Mapper

by Stefan Peters (June 2025)

The Spectral Index Mapper is an interactive web application developed on the Google Earth Engine platform to facilitate the analysis of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. 
It allows users to visualise and compare spectral indices for a defined area and time range. 
The primary aim of the app is to support the Green Triangle Forest Health Group, particularly forestry companies, in assessing forest health and detecting changes in forest cover over time.

The app incorporates the following spectral indices:

1)	NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): 
Measures vegetation health and density. High values indicate healthy, dense vegetation.
2)	EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index): 
Improves on NDVI by reducing atmospheric and soil background effects, useful in dense vegetation.
3)	SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index): 
Minimizes soil brightness influence, ideal for sparse vegetation.
4)	NDMI (Normalized Difference Moisture Index): 
Detects vegetation water content (moisture stress).
5)	NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio): 
Identifies burned areas and fire severity.
6)	NBR2 (Normalized Burn Ratio 2): 
Enhances detection of older burns or low-severity fires.
7)	GCI (Green Chlorophyll Index): 
Estimates chlorophyll content in leaves (sensitive to greenness).
8)	GNDVI (Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): 
Similar to NDVI but uses green band, better for crops with high chlorophyll.
9)	GEMI (Global Environment Monitoring Index): 
Assesses vegetation while minimizing atmospheric effects (less common than NDVI).
10)	NDRE (Normalized Difference Red Edge Index): 
Sensitive to chlorophyll content in vegetation.
11) FDI (Forest Degradation Index): Highlights  forest degradation using Tasseled Cap components.
